I'm taking Web development and Introduction to Databases.

I have a one year old daughter and a wife, we live in Huntsville, AL.
I currently work for Boeing; writing requirements for maintenance and operation
of dry structure on the SLS (Space Launch System) heavy lift vehicle.


Programming Backgroun
My most extensive experience with programming is in C++ as that is what
both intro classes CS161 and CS161 were taught using. I've also used
Javascript, C and Python to varying degrees.

I think I've most enjoyed programming using Python as it is relatively
simple to understand and implement and as I enjoy using whitespace for formatting
and dilineating scope Python works very well with my mindset. That being said I
much prefer the way in which C++ handles objects and object functions (particuarly inheritance).
