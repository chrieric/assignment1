I enjoy programming, reading, and playing video games.
Currently I'm playing WoW, Rift, Eve and XCOM:Enemy withing.
I'm taking Web development and Introduction to Databases.

I have a one year old daughter and a wife, we live in Huntsville, AL.
I currently work for Boeing; writing requirements for maintenance and operation
of dry structure on the SLS (Space Launch System) heavy lift vehicle.
I hope to change careers soon to focus more on software design and/or programming.
