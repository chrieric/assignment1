Bio
I enjoy programming, reading, and playing video games.
Currently I'm playing WoW, Rift, Eve and XCOM:Enemy withing.
I'm taking Web development and Introduction to Databases.

I have a one year old daughter and a wife, we live in Huntsville, AL.
I currently work for Boeing; writing requirements for maintenance and operation
of dry structure on the SLS (Space Launch System) heavy lift vehicle.
My job is not terribly exciting and I don't believe I have the same passion for aerospace
as I do for computer science. I've enjoyed all of my classes so far and really enjoy
both program design and the actual programming process which is a marked difference
from my feelings towards most aerospace work I've done (both in school and on the job).


Programming Background
My most extensive experience with programming is in C++ as that is what
both intro classes CS161 and CS161 were taught using. I've also used
Javascript, C and Python to varying degrees.

I think I've most enjoyed programming using Python as it is relatively
simple to understand and implement and as I enjoy using whitespace for formatting
and dilineating scope Python works very well with my mindset. That being said I
much prefer the way in which C++ handles objects and object functions (particuarly inheritance).
